2.	When were these files compiled?
Lab01-01.exe
 
Lab01-01.dll 
 
Lab01–01.exe → 2010–12–19 16:16:19
Lab01–01.dll → 2010–12–19 16:16:38

3.	Are there any indications that either of these files is packed or obfuscated?
 
 
PEiD can be used to find the packed or obfuscated file although we were able to find all the necessary details and the strings. So we conclude that both of these files were not been packed or obfuscated.
4.	Do any imports hint at what this malware does? If so, which imports are they?

Lab01-01.exe:

-CreateFileA suggests that this Malware might create files.
-CopyFileA suggests that this Malware might copy files.
Lab01-01.dll:
-CreateProcessA gives the information that this Malware will probably create a Process.
-The Malware imports functions from WS2_32.dll such as socket, connect, send, recv, and closesocket which suggests that this Malware might communicate with a server.
-Also, the Sleep import might indicate that the Malware might wait sometime before executing any malicious activity.
 
 
5.	Are there any other files or host-based indicators that you could look for on infected systems?

2.	Are there any indications that this file is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators? If the file is packed, unpack it if possible.
 
We can unpack it running UPX: upx –o Lab01-02_unpacked.exe –d Lab01-02.exe
3.	Do any imports hint at this program’s functionality? If so, which imports are they and what do they tell you? 
The imports of the Unpacked version hint that this Malware has the ability to perform external connections (InternetOpenA and InternetOpenUrlA), also the malware creates a Service (CreateServiceA).
 
4.	What host- or network-based indicators could be used to identify this malware on infected machines?
We can look for the service named MalService via services.msc also we can check for the dnslookups for http://malwareanalysisbook.com/ via a specific Internet Explorer string which will be passed via the browser user-agent FIELD. Moreover we can create a firewall rule to block such traffic.
